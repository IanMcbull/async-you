I am sure you have come across a situation where you had to do
the same {italic}asyncrounous{/italic} call a few times accumulating
the results. For example creating a bunch of test users and persisting
them into a database.

Write a program that will receive a command line argument containing
the url. Using `http.request` send a POST request to

    url + '/users/create'

with the body containing a JSON.stringify'ed object;

    {user_id : 1}

Do this five times with each the `user_id` property being incremented starting
at 1.

Once these requests are done send a GET request to 

    url + '/users'

and console.log the response body.
